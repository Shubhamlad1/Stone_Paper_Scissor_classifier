Image classification model implemented using Resnet-50 architecture.
Transfer learning approach is used excluding top layers.
One Avg pooling layer one Dense layer and one output layers creates as top layers.
In output layer 3 neurons are used for predicting stone, paper and scissor actions.
Model is trained using one epoch only.
